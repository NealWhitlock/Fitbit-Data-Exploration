# Fitbit Data Exploration

Blog post reporting results located [here](https://nealwhitlock.github.io/2020-01-10-2019-Fitbit-Data-Exploration/).

This notebook is for a project after spending time learning exploratory data analysis with Python.

For my dataset in this exploration I chose to use the data a Fitbit Charge 2 tracker had collected over the course of 2019. In the first half of the year as my actvity increased my resting heart rate went on the decline which is what piqued my curiosity and led to this project.

I intend to return to this project and add to it with new information; probably after 2020. With the additional data and skills I have learned and continue to learn I am interested in what other insights I can find.
