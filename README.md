# Fitbit Data Exploration

Blog post reporting results located [here](https://nealwhitlock.github.io/2020-01-10-2019-Fitbit-Data-Exploration/).

This notebook is for a build project after my first unit at Lambda School.

The focus of this unit was on data exploration with a final project demonstrating what we had learned. For my dataset I chose to use the data a Fitbit Charge 2 tracker had collected over the course of 2019.
